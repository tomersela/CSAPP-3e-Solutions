## Data hazards:
Data hazard occures when at least one of the source registers in the Decode stage is also used in the Execution, Memory or Write-back stages.

```
d_srcA in { e_dstE, E_dstM, M_dstM, M_dstE, W_dstM, W_dstE } ||
d_srcB in { e_dstE, E_dstM, M_dstM, M_dstE, W_dstM, W_dstE }
```
However, we should exclude the case of the RNONE register value since this is not a usage of an actual register.
Therefore, data hazard condition will be represented by:
```
(d_srcA != RNONE && d_srcA in { e_dstE, E_dstM, M_dstM, M_dstE, W_dstM, W_dstE }) ||
(d_srcB != RNONE && d_srcB in { e_dstE, E_dstM, M_dstM, M_dstE, W_dstM, W_dstE })
```

In case of a data hazard, we stall the Fetch and Decode stages and inject a bubble to the Execute stage

## Control hazards:
### Handling ret:
In case of a ret instruction going through the Decode, Execute and Memory stages, we need to stall the fetch stage and inject a bubble into Decode stage.

Identifying a ret instruction going through the pipeline:
```
IRET in { D_icode, E_icode, M_icode }
```

### Mispredicted branch:
We can identify a mispredicted branch when the jump instruction reaches the Execute stage:
```
E_icode == IJXX && !e_Cnd
```
In case of a mispredicted branch, we need to clear the processing of instruction that arrive later by inject a bubble to the Decode and Execute stages.


## Putting it all together:
| Hazard                 |                  |        | | Stages       |              |              |              |              |
|------------------------|------------------|--------|-|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| *Branch Misprediction* | *ret processing* | *Data* | | *Fetch*      | *Decode*     | *Execute*    | *Memory*     | *Write-back* |
| No                     | No               | No     | | normal       | normal       | normal       | normal       | normal       |
| No                     | No               | Yes    | | Stall        | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| No                     | Yes              | No     | | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       | normal       |
| Yes                    | No               | No     | | normal       | Bubble       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |

## Hazard Combinations & Edge cases:
Now let's examine what happens if more than one hazard type happen at the same time.

### Combining Branch Misprediction together with ret processing (Combination A of Figure 4.67 in the book):
| Hazard                 | Stages       |              |              |              |              |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|                        | *Fetch*      | *Decode*     | *Execute*    | *Memory*     | *Write-back* |
| *Branch Misprediction* | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       | normal       |
| *ret processing*       | normal       | Bubble       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| *Combination*          | Stall        | Bubble       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |


Branch Misprediction is detected when a JXX instruction is at the Execution Stage and e_Cnd equals 0<br>
The Branch misprediction handling will take precedence and will clear the ret instruction in the Decode stage by injecting a bubble.

```
| Stage      | 
|------------|
| Write-back |
| Memory     |
| Execute    | <- JXX
| Decode     | <- ret
```

The case of ret instruction in the Memory/WB stage and misprediction detected in the Execution state is impossible.<br>
This is because we stall the Fetch Stage and inject a bubble to the Decode and Execute stages
```
| Stage      | 
|------------|
| Write-back |
| Memory     | <- ret
| Execute    | <- JXX (impossible - should be bubble)
| Decode     |
```

### Combining Load/Use (data-hazard in our case) together with ret processing (Combination B of Figure 4.67 in the book):
| Hazard                 | Stages       |              |              |              |              |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|                        | *Fetch*      | *Decode*     | *Execute*    | *Memory*     | *Write-back* |
| *Data*                 | Stall        | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| *ret processing*       | normal       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       | normal       |
| *Combination*          | Stall        | Stall+Bubble | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| *Desired*              | Stall        | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |


### Combining Branch Misprediction with Data hazard:
In this case, the Branch misprediction handling takes precedence and will clear the instruction in the Decode stage by injecting a bubble.

```
| Stage      | 
|------------|
| Write-back |
| Memory     |
| Execute    | <- JXX
| Decode     | <- instruction using register in an advanced stage
```


## Putting it all together (with edge cases):
| Hazard                 |                  |        | | Stages       |              |              |              |              |
|------------------------|------------------|--------|-|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| *Branch Misprediction* | *ret processing* | *Data* | | *Fetch*      | *Decode*     | *Execute*    | *Memory*     | *Write-back* |
| No                     | No               | No     | | normal       | normal       | normal       | normal       | normal       |
| No                     | No               | Yes    | | Stall        | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| No                     | Yes              | No     | | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       | normal       |
| No                     | Yes              | Yes    | | Stall        | Stall        | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| Yes                    | No               | No     | | normal       | Bubble       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| Yes                    | No               | Yes    | | Stall        | Bubble       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| Yes                    | Yes              | No     | | Stall        | Bubble       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |
| Yes                    | Yes              | Yes    | | Stall        | Bubble       | Bubble       | normal       | normal       |


### The logic:
We'll mark Branch Misprediction as "JXX", ret processing as "ret" and Data-hazard as "data"

#### Fetch
* Stall = ret || data
* Bubble = 0

#### Decode
* Stall = data && !JXX
* Bubble = JXX || (ret && !data)

#### Execute
* Stall = 0
* Bubble = JXX || data

#### Memory
No change in the implementation.
We start injecting bubbles as soon as an exception passes through Memory stage

#### 
No change in the implementation.
We stall as soon as an exception reaches the Write-back stage
