```c
#include "csapp.h"

int counter = 0;

void handler(int sig) 
{
    counter++;
    sleep(1); /* Do some work in the handler */
    return;
}

int main() 
{
    int i;

    Signal(SIGUSR2, handler);

    if (Fork() == 0) {  /* Child */
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            Kill(getppid(), SIGUSR2);
            printf("sent SIGUSR2 to parent\n");
        }
        exit(0);
    }

    Wait(NULL);
    printf("counter=%d\n", counter); 
    exit(0);
}
```

While the the parrnt is processing the first SIGUSR2, the child is sending another SIGUSR2 signal which is added to the set of pending signals.
The next 3 signals are sent within the second of the handler method processing time, and therefore ignored.
