```c
void inner4(vec_ptr u, vec_ptr v, data_t *dest)
{
    long i;
    long length = vec_length(u);
    data_t *udata = get_vec_start(u);
    data_t *vdata = get_vec_start(v);
    data_t sum = (data_t) 0;
    for (i = 0; i < length - 6; i += 6) {
        sum = sum + udata[i] * vdata[i];
        sum = sum + udata[i+1] * vdata[i+1];
        sum = sum + udata[i+2] * vdata[i+2];
        sum = sum + udata[i+3] * vdata[i+3];
        sum = sum + udata[i+4] * vdata[i+4];
        sum = sum + udata[i+5] * vdata[i+5];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        sum = sum + udata[i] * vdata[i];
    }

    *dest = sum;
}
```

## A
Each addition operation of the inner loop is dependent on the preceding one, since the sum variable is involved in all additions (read after write).<br>
So even though Intel Core i7 Haswell processor has a capacity of 4 Integer Addition operations, it can't exploit out of order execution in our case.<br>
Therefore, we're unable to achieve a CPE of less than 1.00.

## B
The unrolling didn't affect the results since we're limited to 1 floating point addition per CPU cycle.<br>
Intel Core i7 Haswell processor has a capacity of 1 Addition operation for floating point numbers.
