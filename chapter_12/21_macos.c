    We'll create 10 threads - alternating between a writer thread and a reader thread for 5 times (5 writers and 5 readers in total).

    Each thread is going to print a string including a timestamp and sleep for 1 second.

    Expected results:
    All writer threads runs one after the other
    All readers wait for the writer threads to finish and then run simultaneous
    By looking at the timestamp we should be able to confirm the above expected behavior:
    - writes will run first with Â±1 sec in between
    - readers will run with a short time-difference between them

    3. create another reader thread while all the above are still running
    4. create a second writer thread while all the above are still running

    Expected results:
    Since the two reader threads already started, we should expect them waiting till completion.
    As soon as there's a writer thread waiting, we should make all additional reader executions wait until this writer is done working.
    So the expected sequence is:
    - first 2 reader threads (1) complete
    - then the first writer thread (2) completes
    - then the second writer thread (4) completes
    - then the last reader thread (3) completes.
