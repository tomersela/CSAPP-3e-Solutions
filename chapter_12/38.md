For this solution I created a thread pool to handle prethreading and alternating the number threads.

## Connections Thread Pool
In this solution, I created a Thread pool for handling the connections and threads.
The thread pool will consist of a connection queue for new connections file-descriptors:
- we'll use `sbuf_t` to serve as a FIFO queue
- Our server program will enqueue connection file-descriptors into the connection-buffer
- The threads in our pool will dequeue the connection file-descriptors and run the web-server handler function with that fd

As suggested by the question description:
- We'll double the number of threads in case the connection-buffer is full
  - The main thread that adds new connection will be in charge of that
- We'll halve the number of threads in case the connection-buffer is empty
  - In case we got down to a minimum of 8 threads, we won't halve the threads further
  - Each thread will check if house-keeping is needed after it's done serving the client

### Design principles
- Minimal changes to the TINY server code
- Thread pool encapsulation
  - The thread handling will be hidden from the web-server code
  - The pool will not be aware of which function the server uses to new handle connections (`doit` in the TINY server example)
- The thread pool is responsible to adjust the number of threads (this implementation detail is also hidden from the server code)
- We'll need synchronization for the connection buffer (as with the echo-server prethreaded example)
- We'll need synchronization for the thread management
  - Avoiding race between adding or removing threads activities
  - Avoid killing a thread before it's completed executing the server task

## Implementation

```

Yes, that's it!<br/>
The server creates a `conn_thread_pool` and initizalize it with the `thread_pool_init` function.<br/>
This function also receives the `doit` function as a callback parameter.

When a new connection is received, we pass it to the `thread_pool_new_connection` function.

I also added a Sleep of 1 seconds to the `doit` function in order to mock a "heavy" processing task for my testing later.

### Modifications to sbuf
Besides changing sbuf to support MacOS (There's no support for unamed semaphores in Mac) I also added `sbuf_size` for checking the buffer size.

```c
#include "csapp.h"
#include "sbuf_mac.h"
#include "macos_helpers.h"

/* Create an empty, bounded, shared FIFO buffer with n slots */
/* $begin sbuf_init */
void sbuf_init(sbuf_t *sp, int n)
{
    sp->buf = Calloc(n, sizeof(int));
    sp->n = n;                /* Buffer holds max of n items */
    sp->front = sp->rear = 0; /* Empty buffer iff front == rear */

    sp->mutex = dispatch_semaphore_create(1);
    sp->slots = dispatch_semaphore_create(n);
    sp->items = dispatch_semaphore_create(0);
}
/* $end sbuf_init */

/* Clean up buffer sp */
/* $begin sbuf_deinit */
void sbuf_deinit(sbuf_t *sp)
{
    Free(sp->buf);
}
/* $end sbuf_deinit */

/* Insert item onto the rear of shared buffer sp */
/* $begin sbuf_insert */
void sbuf_insert(sbuf_t *sp, int item)
{
    P_dispatch(sp->slots);                 /* Wait for available slot */
    P_dispatch(sp->mutex);                 /* Lock the buffer */
    sp->buf[(++sp->rear) % (sp->n)] = item; /* Insert the item */
    V_dispatch(sp->mutex);                 /* Unlock the buffer */
    V_dispatch(sp->items);                 /* Announce available item */
}
/* $end sbuf_insert */

/* Remove and return the first item from buffer sp */
/* $begin sbuf_remove */
int sbuf_remove(sbuf_t *sp)
{
    int item;
    P_dispatch(sp->items);                  /* Wait for available item */
    // lock specific thread mutex
    P_dispatch(sp->mutex);                  /* Lock the buffer */
    item = sp->buf[(++sp->front) % (sp->n)]; /* Remove the item */
    V_dispatch(sp->mutex);                  /* Unlock the buffer */
    // unlock specific thread mutex
    V_dispatch(sp->slots);                  /* Announce available slot */
    return item;
}
/* $end sbuf_remove */

int sbuf_size(sbuf_t *sp)
{
    int size;
    P_dispatch(sp->mutex);                 /* Lock the buffer */
    size = sp->rear - sp->front;
    V_dispatch(sp->mutex);                 /* Unlock the buffer */
    return size;
}
```

### Connections thread pool
The pool itself is a struct with the following properties:
- `conn_buf` - the connection buffer for passing connection file-descriptors from the main thread to the pool threads
- `connection_handler` - a pointer to a callback function of the web server (`doit` in the case of TINY)
- `thread_cnt` - represents the number of threads in the pool
- `house_keeping_mutex` - a mutex for protecting thread pool size changes handling
  - This mutex protects the `thread_cnt` property and the pool resizing activities (doubling / halving)
- `thread_mutex` - an array of mutexes for each thread in the pool 
  - Each thread is initiated with an index corresponding to an index in that array
  - Each thread mutex is protecting the update for the corresponding deletion marker (see below)
- `deletion_mark` - an array of integer flags
  - The index of each integers corresponds a thread that was initialized with the same index
  - Value of `1` means that corresponding thread is marked for deletion (we'll use that for halving the number of threads)

#### conn_thread_pool.h
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include "macos_helpers.h"
#include "csapp.h"
#include "sbuf_mac.h"

#define MAX_THREADS 128 // By default MacOS BigSure throws "too many open files" exception in case more than 256 files open concurrently

typedef void (*conn_handler)(int);

typedef struct {
    sbuf_t conn_buf;                                // buffer of connected descriptors
    conn_handler connection_handler;                // connection handler function
    int thread_cnt;                                 // number of active threads
    dispatch_semaphore_t house_keeping_mutex;       // mutex for thread house-keeping activities (adding/remove threads from pool)
    dispatch_semaphore_t thread_mutex[MAX_THREADS]; // semaphore for each thread
    int deletion_mark[MAX_THREADS];                 // semaphore for each thread
} conn_thread_pool;

void thread_pool_init(conn_thread_pool *pool, conn_handler func);
void thread_pool_new_connection(conn_thread_pool *p, int connfd);
```

The pool has 2 functions exposed:
- `thread_pool_init` - initalize a new thread pool with the params:
  - `conn_thread_pool *pool` - pointer to the `conn_thread_pool` struct
  - `conn_handler func` - function to execute for every new connection.
- `thread_pool_new_connection` - enqueue a new connection file-descriptor to the pull
  - `conn_thread_pool *pool` - pointer to the `conn_thread_pool` struct
  - `int connfd` - the new connection file-descriptor

#### conn_thread_pool.c
`thread_pool_init` initialize the pool with 8 threads and a buffer of size 16.<br/>
The function also initialize the `house_keeping_mutex` and a mutex for each thread (`thread_mutex` array).

`thread_pool_new_connection` first check if resize (specifically doubling) is needed the buffer is full.<br/>
It locks the `house_keeping_mutex` to assure there's no other thread resizing the pool size. Then it check the pool's buffer size.<br/>
In case the buffer is full and we have more then the minimal number of threads - we call `increase_threads` to get more available threads to handle new requests.<br/>
Once done, we enqueue the new connection to the buffer.

`increase_threads` creates new threads that runs `threadfunc`.

`threadfunc` contains an inifinite while loop to keep the thread running (as long as needed).<br/>
Within the loop, we first lock the thread mutex, fetch a connection from the buffer, and check if the queue is marked for deletion.<br/>
In case this thread is marked for deletion, we put the connection back to the buffer and end this thread.<br>
But otherwise, we'll handle the new connection by running the handler function (`pool->connection_handler(connfd)`).

After each thread completes the connection serving execution, it checks if the buffer is empty.<br/>
In case the buffer is empty, the thread is being a good boy-scout and mark the thread for deletion.<br/>
The thread count will decrease as more connections arrive.<br/>

## Compiling and running
```
> clang 38.c csapp.c macos_helpers.c conn_thread_pool.c sbuf_mac.c -o 38 && ./38 9999
```

## testing
In order to test this server (appart then using a browser), I created a script that runs 100 concurrent HTTP calls to our server<br/>

### 38_test_conc.sh
Each call is done with curl command as a background job.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..100}; do
    # Run curl command in the background, discarding output
    curl -s -o /dev/null http://localhost:9999 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
done
```
