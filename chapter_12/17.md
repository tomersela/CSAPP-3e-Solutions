## A

The program exits before the new thread has a chance to complete and before 1 second of the Sleep passes.

## B

One option is to use `Pthread_join` which will wait for the thread to complete.

Another option would be to use `Pthread_exit`

From the book (Page 989):
> If the main thread calls pthread_exit, it waits for all other peer threads to terminate and then terminates the main thread and the entire process with a return value of thread_return.
