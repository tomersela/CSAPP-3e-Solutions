```
Initially: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1. 

Thread 1:    Thread 2:    Thread 3:
P(a);        P(c);        P(c);
P(b);        P(b);        V(c);
V(b);        V(b);        P(b);
P(c);        V(c);        P(a);
V(c);        P(a);        V(a);
V(a);        V(a);        V(b);
```

## A
Thread 1 holds the following mutexes simultaneously:
`a` and `b`
`a` and `c`

Thread 2 holds `c` and `b` mutexes simultaneously:

Thread 3 holds `b` and `a` simultaneously

## B
Threads 2 and 3 violates the mutex lock ordering rule

## C
Keep the same order of mutex locking P(a), P(b), P(c) in each thread
