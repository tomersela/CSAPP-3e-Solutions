## Requried behavior

Our implementation should have the following characteristics:
* Only one writer could run its critical section at a time
* Readers can't start while a writer is executing a critical section
* Multiple readers can process their critical section (as long as no writer is active of course)
* Readers wait for all active and pending writers to finish execution
* Writers wait for other writers to complete.
* Writers only wait for readers that already started processing their critical section.

## Implementation
As with other problems, I tried solving this one on macOS.<br/>

Our readers and writers does nothing but printing text lines to stdout and sleep for a seconds.<br/>
Although we're not using shared memory elements in our tests, the line prints will help us test the synchronization and behavior of entering and exiting the critical sections.

### macos_helpers.c
For this I had to write the Mac versions of `P` and `V` as unnamed POSIX semaphores (`sem_t`) are not supported on mac.<br/>
Instead I used `dispatch_semaphore_t` as suggested by this [stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24617282/1163424).<br/>
I added alternative versions for `P` and `V` - `P_dispatch` and `V_dispatch` inside `macos_helpers.c`.<br/>
I also included `timeStr` helper method for printing the time value in the tests.

```c
#include <dispatch/dispatch.h>
#include <mach/mach_time.h>
#include "csapp.h"
#include "assert.h"

void P_dispatch(dispatch_semaphore_t sem)
{
    if (dispatch_semaphore_wait(sem, DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER) < 0)
        unix_error("P error");
}

void V_dispatch(dispatch_semaphore_t sem)
{
    if (dispatch_semaphore_signal(sem) < 0)
        unix_error("V error");
}

void timeStr(char buffer[26], int *ms)
{
    int millisec;
    struct tm *tm_info;
    struct timeval tv;

    gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);

    millisec = lrint(tv.tv_usec / 1000.0); // Round to nearest millisec
    if (millisec >= 1000)
    { // Allow for rounding up to nearest second
        millisec -= 1000;
        tv.tv_sec++;
    }

    tm_info = localtime(&tv.tv_sec);

    strftime(buffer, 26, "%H:%M:%S", tm_info);
    *ms = millisec;
}
```


## 21_macos.c

### initialization
Before we start, we should initialize 2 counters:
* `int readcnt` - represents the number of active readers
* `int writecnt` - represents the number of active or waiting writers

All counters are initalize with the value of 0.

We'll also initialize 3 mutexes:
* `r` - this mutex will serve as our read lock. reader will acquire and release immediately, writers will lock it before entering their critical section.
* `w` - will serve as our write lock. readers will acquire this lock when they start their critical section execution and release when leaving the critical section.
* `mutex` - used to synchronize the access to the above counters and mutexes.

All mutexes are initalize with the value of 1.

```c
void init()
{
    readcnt = 0;
    writecnt = 0;
    r = dispatch_semaphore_create(1);
    w = dispatch_semaphore_create(1);
    mutex = dispatch_semaphore_create(1);

    shared = 0;
}
```


### reader
Our reader first check that read operation isn't locked by checking the `r` mutex - It will acquire and release this mutex right after.<br/>
As we'll see later, the writer acquires the `r` mutex and only release it once done and if there are no other writers pending or executing.<br/>
Then (if no active writers), we increase `readcnt` and lock writers by acquiring the `w` mutex<br/>
Only once all active readers are done, we release `w`.<br/>
But notice new cerated readers will be locked by the `r` mutex in case of a pending writer.

```c
void *reader(void *vargp)
{
    int *i = (int *)vargp;
    char timebuf[26];
    int millisec;

    P_dispatch(r); // This will block in case a write operation is pending or ongoing
    V_dispatch(r);

    P_dispatch(mutex);
    readcnt++;
    if (readcnt == 1)
        P_dispatch(w); /* Lock writes */
    V_dispatch(mutex);

    /* Critical section */
    /* Reading happens */
    timeStr(timebuf, &millisec);
    printf("%s.%03d: ", timebuf, millisec);
    printf("I'm reading %d!\n", *i);
    Sleep(1);
    printf("Done reading %d!\n", *i);

    P_dispatch(mutex);
    readcnt--;
    if (readcnt == 0)
        V_dispatch(w); /* Unlock writes */
    V_dispatch(mutex);

    return NULL;
}
```

### writer
The writer will first increase `writecnt` and lock reads (`r`) on the first created writer.<br/>
Then for the critical section, we'll use the `w` mutex to make sure only one writer is able to access the critical section at any given time.<br/>

Lastly, in case there are no more pending or active writer threads, we'll also allow access for readers by releasing the `r` mutex.

```c
void *writer(void *vargp)
{
    int *i = (int *)vargp;
    char timebuf[26];
    int millisec;

    P_dispatch(mutex);
    writecnt++;
    if (writecnt == 1) // First in
        P_dispatch(r); // block reads
    V_dispatch(mutex);

    P_dispatch(w); /* Lock writes */

    // /* Critical section */
    // /* Writing happens */
    timeStr(timebuf, &millisec);
    printf("%s.%03d: ", timebuf, millisec);
    printf("Started writing %d!\n", *i);
    Sleep(1);
    printf("Done writing %d!\n", *i);

    V_dispatch(w); /* Unlock writes */

    P_dispatch(mutex);
    writecnt--;
    if (writecnt == 0)
        V_dispatch(r); // release reads
    V_dispatch(mutex);

    return NULL;
}
```

Important to notice that we use the same mutex (`mutex`) for accessing both reader and writer counters (`readcnt`, `writecnt`) and mutexes (`r`, `w`).


## Testing
Testing the program is important in order to test the program behave as expected.

### Scenarions
The program include three methods for testing the synchronization behavior under different conditions.

#### Simultaneous reads
Here we test that multiple readers can run the reader's critical section simultenously, but only one writer can run the writer's critical section at the same time.

##### Flow
We'll create 10 threads - alternating between a writer thread and a reader thread for 5 times (5 writers and 5 readers in total).<br/>
Each thread is going to print a string including a timestamp and sleep for 1 second.

##### Expected results
All writer threads runs one after the other
All readers wait for the writer threads to finish and then run simultaneous
By looking at the timestamp we should be able to confirm the above expected behavior:
- each writer thread will exclusivity run the critical section
- readers will overlap in execution time

##### Test code
```c
void test_simultaneous_reads()
{
    printf("\ntest_simultaneous_reads:\n");

    int N = 10;
    pthread_t tid[N];
    int nums[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        nums[i] = i;
        Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, i % 2 ? reader : writer, &nums[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_join(tid[i], NULL);

    printf("\n");
}
```

##### Results
Here's the console output for this test:
```
test_simultaneous_reads:
16:57:24.241: Started writing 0!
Done writing 0!
16:57:25.248: Started writing 2!
Done writing 2!
16:57:26.250: Started writing 4!
Done writing 4!
16:57:27.255: Started writing 6!
Done writing 6!
16:57:28.259: Started writing 8!
Done writing 8!
16:57:29.259: I'm reading 1!
16:57:29.260: I'm reading 3!
16:57:29.260: I'm reading 5!
16:57:29.260: I'm reading 7!
16:57:29.260: I'm reading 9!
Done reading 3!
Done reading 5!
Done reading 7!
Done reading 9!
Done reading 1!
```

- We can see a Â±second width between writers.
- Readers run concurrently
- The reads wait at least a second after the last writer is done.

#### Favour writers
While there are active read operations, we should have writes waiting

##### Flow
All threads in this test are scheduled immediatly one after the other at the following order:
1. create 2 reader threads
2. create writer thread while the read threads are running
3. create another reader thread while all the above are still running
4. create a second writer thread while all the above are still running

##### Expected results
Since the two reader threads already started, we should expect them waiting till completion.<br/>
As soon as there's a writer thread waiting, we should make all additional reader executions wait until this writer is done working.<br/>
So the expected sequence is:
- first 2 reader threads (1) complete
- then the first writer thread (2) completes
- then the second writer thread (4) completes
- then the last reader thread (3) completes.

##### Test code
```c
void test_favour_writers()
{
    printf("\ntest_favour_writers:\n");

    int N = 5;

    pthread_t tid[N];
    // 1
    Pthread_create(&tid[0], NULL, reader, &(int){11});
    Pthread_create(&tid[1], NULL, reader, &(int){12});
    // 2
    Pthread_create(&tid[2], NULL, writer, &(int){2}); // this should wait until the first two reads complete
    // 3
    Pthread_create(&tid[3], NULL, reader, &(int){3}); // this should wait until all writes complete, means it should come last
    // 4
    Pthread_create(&tid[4], NULL, writer, &(int){4}); // this should get precedence over the previous write thread (3)

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_join(tid[i], NULL);

    printf("\n");
}
```

##### Results
```
test_favour_writers:
16:57:30.264: I'm reading 11!
16:57:30.264: I'm reading 12!
Done reading 11!
Done reading 12!
16:57:31.268: Started writing 2!
Done writing 2!
16:57:32.275: Started writing 4!
Done writing 4!
16:57:33.280: I'm reading 3!
Done reading 3!
```

- Our first two readers runs concurrently
- The first writer is waiting for the readers to finish before starting
- The second writer is favoured over the third reader that was scheduled before it


#### Writers wait for already executing readers to finish
Writers should wait for readers to finsish the critical section processing before starting executing their critical section.<br/>
Though this scenario was tested indirectly by the former test, it's a good practice to write a simpler test that explicitly test a specific behavior.

##### Flow
We're going to initialize a reader and right afer initialize a writer.

##### Expected results
we should see the writer starts only once the reader is done.

##### Test code
```c
void test_writer_waits_for_reader_to_finish()
{
    printf("\ntest_writer_waits_for_reader_to_finish:\n");

    int N = 2;

    pthread_t tid[N];
    Pthread_create(&tid[0], NULL, reader, &(int){1});
    Pthread_create(&tid[1], NULL, writer, &(int){2});

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_join(tid[i], NULL);

    printf("\n");
}
```

##### Results
```
test_writer_waits_for_reader_to_finish:
16:57:34.283: I'm reading 1!
Done reading 1!
16:57:35.286: Started writing 2!
Done writing 2!
```

The writer starts after the already running reader is done executing.
