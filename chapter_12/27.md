The main problem arises from the way file descriptors are managed within a processes.

When a new file descriptor is created, the descriptor number picked by the kernel is the minimal available number for the current process.

So imagine the following scenarions for thread A and thread B:

```
1 Thread A                  Thread B
2 fdopen(sockfd, "r")
3 fdopen(sockfd, "w")
4 fclose(fpin)
5                                                   <-- Context switch + new socketfd generated
6                           fdopen(sockfd, "r")
7                           fdopen(sockfd, "w")
8                                                   <-- Context switch
9 fclose(fpout)
```

When Thread A closes fpin, the sockedfd used is also closed and becomes available.<br/>
Now Thread B might reuse this fd when creating a new socket descriptor number.<br/>
Switiching back to thread A will close the file descriptor used by Thread B that might still working with it.
