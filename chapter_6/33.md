CI = 0b010 (Index 2)

We have 2 valid cache lines with tags - 0xBC, 0xB6

For cache line with tag 0xBC:

CT = 0xBC = 0b10111100

together with the CI bits, the addresses that will hit that cache line are of the format:
```
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CI | CI | CI | CO | CO |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  1 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  X |  X |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  12   11   10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0 
```

Which correspondes to the addresses: 0x1788 - 0x178B

For cache line with tag 0xB6:

CT = 0xB6 = 0b10110110

together with the CI bits, the addresses that will hit that cache line are of the format:
```
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CT | CI | CI | CI | CO | CO |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  1 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  X |  X |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  12   11   10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0 
```

Which correspondes to the addresses: 0x16C8 - 0x16CB

Conclusion: The addresses in range 0x1788 - 0x178B and in range 0x16C8 - 0x16CB will have a cache hit in set 2.
