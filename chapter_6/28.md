As noted in the solution for Homework Problem 6.27, addresses of our cache system has the following structure:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | s | s | s | b | b |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```


## A
Set 2 doesn't have any cache lines. Therefore none of the addresses will hit set 2.


## B
Any address of the following form will hit set 4:
```
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
| t | | t | t | t | t | | t | t | t | 1 | | 0 | 0 | b | b |
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
```
Considering different values of block offset bits (b), the least significant 5 bits options are:
```
0b10000
0b10001
0b10010
0b10011
```

The cache in question holds two cache-lines in set 4 with the tag bits:
```
0xc7 = 0b11000111
0x05 = 0b00000101
```

Therefore our address options considering the values above, the following address will hit set 4:
```
0b1100011110000 = 0x18f0
0b1100011110001 = 0x18f1
0b1100011110010 = 0x18f2
0b1100011110011 = 0x18f3
0b0000010110000 = 0x00b0
0b0000010110001 = 0x00b1
0b0000010110010 = 0x00b2
0b0000010110011 = 0x00b3
```


## C
Any address of the following form will hit set 5:
```
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
| t | | t | t | t | t | | t | t | t | 1 | | 0 | 1 | b | b |
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
```
Considering different values of block offset bits (b), the least significant 5 bits options are:
```
0b10100
0b10101
0b10110
0b10111
```

Our cache holds only one valid cache-line in set 5 with the tag bits:
```
0x71 = 0b01110001
```

Therefore our address options considering the values above, the following address will hit set 5:
```
0b0111000110100 = 0x0e34
0b0111000110101 = 0x0e35
0b0111000110110 = 0x0e36
0b0111000110111 = 0x0e37
```


## D
Any address of the following form will hit set 7:
```
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
| t | | t | t | t | t | | t | t | t | 1 | | 1 | 1 | b | b |
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
```
Considering different values of block offset bits (b), the least significant 5 bits options are:
```
0b11100
0b11101
0b11110
0b11111
```

Our cache holds only one valid cache-line in set 7 with the tag bits:
```
0xde = 0b11011110
```

Therefore our address options considering the values above, the following address will hit set 7:
```
0b1101111011100 = 0x1bdc
0b1101111011101 = 0x1bdd
0b1101111011110 = 0x1bde
0b1101111011111 = 0x1bdf
```
