## A
We have 16 * 16 iterationa and 4 writes per iteration.
The total number of writes is 16 * 16 * 4 = 1024

## B
A block size is 32 bytes, means 8 integers fits one block (`sizeof(int)` = 4).<br>
Our iterations runs on consequtive space in memory (starting at address 0). So we can assume that for every 8 memory writes, 7 are a cache hit and one is a miss.<br>
We have total of 1024 / 8 = 128 cache misses.

## C

$\frac{Cache\ misses}{Memory\ writes} = \frac{128}{1024} = \frac{1}{8} = 12.5 \\%$
