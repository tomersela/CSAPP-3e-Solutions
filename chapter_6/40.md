```c
// Y loop
for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 16; j++) {
        square[i][j].y = 1;
    }
}

// CMK loop
for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 16; j++) {
        square[i][j].c = 0;
        square[i][j].m = 0;
        square[i][j].k = 0;
    }
}
```

## A
$Y\ loop = 16 * 16 = 256$

$CMK\ loop = 16 * 16 * 3 = 768$

$Total\ number\ of\ writes = Yloop + CMKloop = 1024$

## B
For the first part of the code - the Y loop, we get misses 50% of the times. This is because every two `point_color` structs fits once cache.<br>
For every even index of j we get a miss and for odd index of j we get a hit.

$Y\ loop\ misses = 16 * 16 / 2 = 128$


For the CMK loop, for even values of j, we get a miss when referencing the c property, but a hit for the m and k properties (1/3 miss rate).<br>
But also here, we get a hit for all iterations of and odd j value (0/3 miss).<br>
Means for every 6 writes, we have 1 miss.

$CMK\ loop\ misses = 16 * 16 * 3\ /\ 6 = 128$

We have total of 128 + 128 = 256 cache misses


## C

$\frac{Cache\ misses}{Memory\ writes} = \frac{256}{1024} = 25 \\%$
