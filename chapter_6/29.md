## A

$b = \log_{2}{B} = \log_{2}{4} = 2$

$s = \log_{2}{S} = \log_{2}{4} = 2$

$t = m - (s + b) = 12 - (2 + 2) = 8$

| Read      | 0x834   | No   | unknown                 |
| Write     | 0x836   | Yes  | unknown                 |

### Read 0x834
0x834 = 0b100000110100

Set = 1

Block offset = 0b00 = 0

Tag = 0b10000011 = 0x83

There's no valid cache line tag with the value 0x83 at Set 1 (there's a cache-line with such tag, but it's invalid).

In this operation, a cache-line with tag 0x83 was loaded to set 1 with the values of addresses 0x834 - 0x837

### Write	0x836

0x836 = 0b100000110110

Set = 1

Block offset = 0b10 = 2

tag = 0b10000011 = 0x83

In the previous operation (Read 0x834), the value of address 0x836 was loaded to the cache. Therefore, this is a hit.

### Read 0xFFD

0xFFD = 0b111111111101

Set = 3

Block offset = 0b01 = 1

tag = 0xFF

There's a valid cache-line with tag 0xFF at Set 3. The value of the byte with offset 1 in the block is 0xC0
