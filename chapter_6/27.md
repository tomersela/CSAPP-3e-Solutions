Practice Problem 6.12 presents a cache with the following settings:

$m = 13$

$E = 2$

$B = 4$

$S = 8$

Which means:

$b = \log_{2}{B} = \log_{2}{4} = 2$

$s = \log_{2}{S} = \log_{2}{8} = 3$

$t = m - (s + b) = 13 - (3 + 2) = 8$

Therfore, addresses of our cache system has the following structure:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | s | s | s | b | b |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```


## A
Any address of the following form will hit set 1:
```
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
| t | | t | t | t | t | | t | t | t | 0 | | 0 | 1 | b | b |
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
```
Considering different values of block offset bits (b), the least significant 5 bits options are:
```
0b00100
0b00101
0b00110
0b00111
```

The cache in question holds two cache-lines in set 1 with the tag bits:
```
0x45 = 0b01000101
0x38 = 0b00111000
```

Therefore our address options considering the values above, the following address will hit set 1:
```
0b0100010100100 = 0x8a4
0b0100010100101 = 0x8a5
0b0100010100110 = 0x8a6
0b0100010100111 = 0x8a7
0b0011100000100 = 0x704
0b0011100000101 = 0x705
0b0011100000110 = 0x706
0b0011100000111 = 0x707
```


## B
Any address of the following form will hit set 6:
```
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
| t | | t | t | t | t | | t | t | t | 1 | | 1 | 0 | b | b |
+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+
```
Considering different values of block offset bits (b), the least significant 5 bits options are:
```
0b11000
0b11001
0b11010
0b11011
```

our cache holds one cache-line in set 6 with the tag bits -
```
0x91 = 0b010010001
```

Therefore our address options considering the values above, the following address will hit set 6:
```
0b01001000111000 = 0x1238
0b01001000111001 = 0x1239
0b01001000111010 = 0x123a
0b01001000111011 = 0x123b
```
