First let's explore the issue by considering on some possible values of x:<br>
Obviously, x can't be 0, since in that case every track will have zero bytes.<br>
If x = r then we have one track of length 2*PI*r worth of bits.<br>
Therefore 0 < x < 1.

Let's denote $d$ as the distance between two consequtive tracks.<br>
Given that the hole radius is $x*r$, we have $\frac{( r-x*r)}{d}$ tracks between the hole track to the most outer track.<br>
Each track has $x*2*\pi*r$ worth of bits (the circumference of the hole).<br>
To total number of track length is:<br>

$\frac{\left(r - x * r \right)}{d} * x * 2 * \pi * r = \frac{ \left( 1 - x \right) * r}{d} * x * 2 * \pi * r = (2x-2x^{2})*\frac{r^{2} *\pi }{d}$

This is a function of $x$ that has a max point at $\frac{1}{2}$:

$\frac{d}{dx}\left(\left( 2x-2x^{2}\right)  * \frac{r^{2} *\pi }{d}\right) =( 2-4x) *\frac{r^{2} *\pi }{d}$

Max point:

$( 2-4x) *\frac{r^{2} *\pi }{d} = 0$

$2-4x=0$

$x=\frac{1}{2}$
